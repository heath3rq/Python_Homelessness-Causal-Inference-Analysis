## Effect of providing permanent housing for the homeless on per capita homeless rates in US cities.

### Project Question
What is the effect of providing permanent housing for the homeless on per capita homeless rates?

### Project Summary

The purpose of this analysis was to understand the impact on homelessness by providing permanent housing for the homeless. In the mid 2000s, after early empirical success, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implemented the Housing First approach (McEvers & Pendleton, 2015). Since adoption, some cities have substantially reduced homelessness, while others have struggled. In turn, the effectiveness of this approach has been questioned. This particular analysis studied the effect from providing permanent housing (for the homeless) on per capita homeless rates between 2007 and 2021. Understanding the relationship between providing permanent housing and homeless rates could better drive investment decisions when combating homelessness.

The relationship was modeled with a linear regression including fixed and time effects, along with a number of expected confounding variables, to measure the causal relationship between permanent housing resources and homelessness; however, the results of this project suggest that there is no causal relationship between permanent housing resources and homelessness, and only found a relationship between homelessness and the confounding demographic variables (race, ethnicity, and gender). 

Therefore, this analysis recommends the following approach. First, further analyze the factors causing the underlying demographic inequality across the cities with the largest homeless population, specifically with respect to healthcare, education, and income. Second, increase resources in data collection on homelessness, which includes additional measurement of homelessness in each of these cities, and collection of publicly available measurement of addiction and health data. Third, explore alternative investments in fighting homelessness beyond permanent housing in a Housing First approach, that are also targeted at reducing the underlying demographic inequality correlated with homelessness.
